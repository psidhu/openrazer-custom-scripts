#+TITLE: openrazer-custom-scripts

The intention of this project is to store any custom scripts I write
to control my razer stuff through openrazer.

* snek.py
  So this is a fun one. I wrote an automated snake program to run over
  my keyboards' keys. The game plays out as normal, using dumb
  movements to move the snake (named snek) around.

  Currently it's designed for a standard TKL (e.g. Huntsman TE) as I
  limit where the snek game plays out. May attempt to make this
  smarter in the future, but it's where I like it for now.

  To run in the background, open a new terminal and:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  python3 ./snek.py &
  disown -a && exit
  #+END_SRC
